# 🔐 Streamlit Multi-Auth System

This project demonstrates the use of **abstract classes** and **inheritance** in Python, implemented with a **Streamlit UI**. It simulates a multi-authentication system using three mock login methods:  
- 📧 Email/Password  
- 🟢 Google  
- 🔵 Facebook

## 🚀 Features

- Demonstrates use of `@abstractmethod` for class abstraction.
- Simple, clean Streamlit UI for interacting with different auth methods.
- Practical example for beginners to understand Object-Oriented Programming (OOP).
- Inspired by a classroom example from **Sir Hamzah Syed** to enhance conceptual clarity.
